TASK: Refactor large, monolithic system files.
Explanation:
- Start with 'engine/systems/InputManager.ts'.
- Move combo-checking logic into its own 'InputComboTracker' class.
- Move action-binding logic into its own 'InputActionMapper' class.
- The 'InputManager' should be a smaller facade that coordinates these smaller, single-responsibility classes.
- engine/systems/AudioManager.ts: split this into an AudioManager facade that coordinates smaller, specialized classes like MusicPlayer, SfxPool, and VoicePlayer.
- engine/systems/SaveManager.ts: The migration logic (migrateIfNeeded, getVersionPath) could be extracted into its own dedicated MigrationManager class, which the SaveManager would then use.

TASK: Refactor the project into a proper Nx monorepo structure.
Explanation:
- This is a larger structural change.
- Create a 'packages/' directory.
- Move the current 'engine/' code into 'packages/engine/src/'.
- Create a 'packages/plugins/' directory for 'InventoryManagerPlugin', etc.
- Create a 'packages/example-game/' directory to build a simple game that *uses* the engine, proving the 'plug-and-develop' concept.
- This will properly leverage the Nx configuration files.
