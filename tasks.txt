TASK: Properly implement the SceneRenderer / UIRenderer split.
Explanation:
- The current helpers ('SceneRenderer.ts', 'UIRenderer.ts') are a good start but aren't fully integrated.
- 'RenderManager' should be aware of two distinct pipelines: a world-space pipeline (for 'SceneRenderer') and a screen-space/UI pipeline (for 'UIRenderer').
- 'RenderManager' should always render the UI pipeline *after* the scene pipeline to ensure UI is on top.
- 'SceneRenderer' should be the only one concerned with camera/world coordinates. 'UIRenderer' should only use fixed screen coordinates.

TASK: Refactor large, monolithic system files.
Explanation:
- Start with 'engine/systems/InputManager.ts'.
- Move combo-checking logic into its own 'InputComboTracker' class.
- Move action-binding logic into its own 'InputActionMapper' class.
- The 'InputManager' should be a smaller facade that coordinates these smaller, single-responsibility classes.

TASK: Refactor the project into a proper Nx monorepo structure.
Explanation:
- This is a larger structural change.
- Create a 'packages/' directory.
- Move the current 'engine/' code into 'packages/engine/src/'.
- Create a 'packages/plugins/' directory for 'InventoryManagerPlugin', etc.
- Create a 'packages/example-game/' directory to build a simple game that *uses* the engine, proving the 'plug-and-develop' concept.
- This will properly leverage the Nx configuration files.
